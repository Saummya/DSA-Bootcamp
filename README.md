## Week1
### The C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
- Containers
- Algorithm
- Iterators

**Containers**

1.Sequential
 - vectors
 - stack
 - queue
 - pair(it is not a conatiner)
 2. Ordered
 - Maps
 - Multimap
 - Set
 - Multiset
 3. Unordered
 - unordered_map
 - unordred_set

**Algorithm**

1. sort(comparator)
2. max_element
3. min_element
4. reverse
5. count
6. find
7. accumulate
8. upper_bound
9. lower_bound
10. next_permutations
11. pre_permutations

**Iterators**

1. begin() :- This function is used to return the beginning position of the container.

2. end() :- This function is used to return the after end position of the container.
3. vector<int>::iterator itr
